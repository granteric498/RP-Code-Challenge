### Sparkling Water Distribution
You and 12 of your coworkers have just sat down for a long meeting and you decide to get drinks for everyone.    
The fridge has 4 cans of berry-flavored water, 4 cans of citrus-flavored water, 4 cans of regular water, and 1 can of your favorite flavor: coconut. You bring the drinks to the meeting room and let everyone know that you will distribute the cans “fairly” by arranging the cans in a circle, and starting with a “random” can, you will distribute every 13th can until they are all gone and you get the last can.    
For example, if you start with the 12th can, you will end up giving away the coconut flavor to the second person.
### Mapping Robot
You are tasked with generating a list of directions to each of our clients’ offices. You have a robot capable of roaming the streets in search of a destination, but it only has the ability to turn left or right and move forward any number of blocks; it does not necessarily take the most direct route.    
The robot stores data on each route including the date of the trip, the name of the destination, and a comma-separated list of actions taken. Each action is comprised of a rotation (L – left, R – right) and a number of blocks.  
- Assumptions:
  -	The robot always starts facing West.
  -	The city spans an infinite number of blocks in every direction.
  -	The robot always reaches its destination.
